<p title="About Me">Hi, I'm Katherine. I am a Bay Area native who is an upcoming senior at Milpitas High School. This Summer I am participating in Girls Who Code at Adobe so I can establish my
coding knowledge and meet new people with similar interests to me. </p>

<br>

<p>
I like to listen to music, do riddles, watch Netflix, and play games on Facebook Messenger. I also like to hike, but I'm too lazy to exercise. One thing I don't like is mushrooms. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
<strong>Fun Facts:</strong> 
<ul>
   <li>I have a high spice tolerance.</li>
   <li>My hair color is natural.</li>

</ul>
