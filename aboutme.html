<h1>Katherine Hubeny</h1> <br>
  
<p title="About Me">Hi, I'm Katherine. I am a Bay Area native who is an upcoming senior at Milpitas High School. This Summer I am participating in Girls Who Code at Adobe so I can establish my
coding knowledge and meet new people with similar interests to me. I like to go hiking, watch Netflix, and play games on Facebook Messenger.</p>
